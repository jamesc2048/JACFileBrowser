# JACFileBrowser

Cross platform file browser for people who want the best out of all file managers.
Optimised for speed and productivity.
Eventually will be fully configurable but for now defaults to fulfill my own current needs/preferences.

## Planned:
- [x] Basic file browser functionality (browse directories, open files)
- [x] Table View
- [x] Table column resizing 
- [x] Table column sorting
- [x] Open the directory in native file browser
- [ ] Left pane populated with drives and shortcuts according to system
- [ ] Table item Selection
- [ ] Table sorting customisation 
- [ ] Context menu basic actions
- [ ] File operations (move, copy, delete, create etc) 
## Version 0.1
- [ ] File operations queuing (kind of like TeraCopy)
- [ ] In app media preview
- [ ] Split Image preview in right pane (mac os style?)
- [ ] Theming / dark mode
- [ ] Full keyboard navigation
- [ ] Fast Search for file by typing beginning characters (best Windows explorer feature)
- [ ] Per-user Settings
- [ ] Gestures (like Chrome: e.g. double finger swipe left/right for forward/back)
- [ ] Extensible context menus
- [ ] Extensions/Plugins
- [ ] Tabs
- [ ] Save state of tabs on close
- [ ] Search in folder with no reloading (filter)
- [ ] Search in folder with no reloading (regex)
- [ ] Search in all descendant folders but with better UI than Explorer and faster 
- [ ] Split / merge tabs
- [ ] Drag and drop 
- [ ] Grid View
- [ ] GridView thumbnails
- [ ] Preview engines (plugins for previews)
- [ ] Drag and drop into links to side (favourites)
- [ ] Drag and drop for moving files/folders
- [ ] Github actions for builds
- [ ] Different icon for not empty folder 
- [ ] Warn on deleting empty folder
- [ ] Dismount drives and also notify what files are locked if not possible
- [ ] Extensible "operations" system (kind of like windows shell commands but not using them directly, they are so slow)
- [ ] Watch folder for file additions (QFileSystemWatcher?)
- [ ] Watch drives for changes
- [ ] File operations (cut copy paste create delete, with queuing)
- [ ] read zip/7z/etc file as folder (without unzipping)
- [ ] zip/7z/etc file operations
- [ ] Android?
