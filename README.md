# JACFileBrowser

Windows 11 Explorer still hasn't got tabs and advanced features. Guess I've got to make my own!

Cross platform file browser for people who are tired of Windows Explorer and hopping between different Linux file managers.

Planned:
- [x] Table View
- [x] Grid View
- [x] Selection
- [ ] GridView thumbnails
- [ ] In app media preview
- [ ] Tabs
- [ ] Full keyboard navigation
- [ ] Extensible context menus
- [ ] Extensions/Plugins
- [ ] Drag and drop 
- [ ] Split / merge tabs
- [ ] Android?
- [ ] Preview engines (plugins for previews)
